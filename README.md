# Allow me to introduce myself...
## My name is Chris
### And your best bet is to find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/cjbec)

## You'll really just find a list of links to my various projects here

#### As it stands today, I'm working on probably too many things, but here they are:

[DynastySZN](https://www.dynastyszn.com) is my Dynasty fantasy football league, powered by the awesome people at Sleeper

[Real Folk Grooves](http://www.realfolkgrooves.com) is a great way to find (and immediately accept as your own) my taste in music

[cjbec.me](https://www.cjbec.me) is my very-much-so-not-good-still-a-work-in-progress social media landing page

And last, but certainly not least, you can find me at [cjbec.io](https://www.cjbec.io) for all things about my professional life
