# Allow me to introduce myself...
## My name is Chris
### And your best bet is to find me on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/cjbec)

## You'll really just find a list of links to my various projects here

#### As it stands today, I'm working on probably too many things, but here they are:
[DynastySZN](www.dynastyszn.com) is my Dynasty fantasy football league, powered by the awesome people at Sleeper
[Real Folk Grooves](www.realfolkgrooves.com) is a great way to find (and immediately accept as your own) my taste in music
[cjbec.me](www.cjbec.me) is my very-much-so-not-good-still-a-work-in-progress social media landing page
And last, but certainly not least, you can find me at [cjbec.io](www.cjbec.io) for all things about my professional life
